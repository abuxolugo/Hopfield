# Neural Networks
A work in progress, but this is meant to be a kind of neural network bestiary with tutorials and code for architectures that might 
be useful to researchers in cognitive science. Fair warning: I'm not a programmer, so feel free to improve on these (and let me know if
you have any feedback).


To be expanded.
